# How does iris work?
Iris is based on the same principles that make bittorrent and bitcoin secure and safe protocols. It was built for sharing content in a categorized, moderated but open and free way.

## Feeds
Feeds represent a categorized set of cronologically ordered content. Feeds are denoted soley by a UUID, and a keypair. Feeds can be owned by individuals, or groups, however only one person should ever have access too the base keypair as it can be used to control all other feed actions.

## Control Ledger
The control ledger is a ledger of modifications and adjustments to the content ledger and feed. It is generally used to modify meta data, moderate content, or add/remove admin keypairs.

## Content Ledger
The content ledger represents a chronological feed of all content published to a feed.
