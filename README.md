# Iris
Iris is a decentralized, distributed network for sharing content. It's designed and built after the same concepts that drive Bitcoin and Bittorrent, and was specifically engineered to combat the common problems with online message boards. Iris is only a backing protocol and API for larger applications that wish to serve and display content.

## How?
Iris uses the P2P networking of bittorrent, combined with the blockhain of Bitcoin to provide a reliable, consistent, decentrilized and distributed network for sharing blobs of raw data.

## Status
Iris is currently heavily in the R&D phase of its lifetime. Right now it's just a farfetched concept which serves to be proved.
